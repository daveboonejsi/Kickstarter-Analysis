An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
 
### Analysis of Outcomes based on Goals
---
 In this analysis we looked at the outcomes (successful, failed, canceled) of kickstarter campaigns based on the the goals set for the fundraisers.  The analysis was limited to plays in the US. 
 Some conclusions:
 ---
 *Most of the campaigns failed at the upper ranges of the goals which indicates that setting a goal too high may doom the campaign to failure
 ---
 *There were no campaigns that were canceled for plays.
 ---
 *The small numbers in the higher goal categories gave rise to some funky results, e.g. 80 percent success rate in the 35K-40K range (going somewhat against the trend).
